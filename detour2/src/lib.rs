//! A cross-platform detour library written in Rust.
//!
//! ## Intro
//!
//! This library provides a thread-safe, inline detouring functionality by
//! disassembling and patching functions during runtime, using assembly opcodes
//! allocated within executable memory. It modifies the target functions and
//! replaces their prolog with an unconditional jump.
//!
//! Beyond the basic functionality this library handles several different edge
//! cases:
//!
//! - Relative branches.
//! - RIP relative operands.
//! - Detects NOP-padding.
//! - Relay for large offsets (>2GB).
//! - Supports hot patching.
//!
//! ## Detours
//!
//! Three different types of detours are provided:
//!
//! - [Static](./struct.StaticDetour.html): A static & type-safe interface.
//!   Thanks to its static nature it can accept a closure as its detour, but is
//!   required to be statically defined at compile time.
//!
//! - [Generic](./struct.GenericDetour.html): A type-safe interface â€” the same
//!   prototype is enforced for both the target and the detour. It is also
//!   enforced when invoking the original target.
//!
//! - [Raw](./struct.RawDetour.html): The underlying building block that the
//!   others types abstract upon. It has no type-safety and interacts with raw
//!   pointers. It should be avoided unless any types are references, or not
//!   known until runtime.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **nightly**: Enabled by default. Required for static detours, due to usage
//!   of *const_fn* & *unboxed_closures*.   The feature also enables a more
//!   extensive test suite.
//!
//! ## Platforms
//!
//! - Both `x86` & `x86-64` are supported.
//!
//! ## Procedure
//!
//! To illustrate a detour on an x86 platform:
//!
//! ```c
//! 0 int return_five() {
//! 1     return 5;
//! 00400020 [b8 05 00 00 00] mov eax, 5
//! 00400025 [c3]             ret
//! 2 }
//! 3
//! 4 int detour_function() {
//! 5     return 10;
//! 00400040 [b8 0A 00 00 00] mov eax, 10
//! 00400045 [c3]             ret
//! 6 }
//! ```
//!
//! To detour `return_five` the library by default tries to replace five bytes
//! with a relative jump (the optimal scenario), which works in this case.
//! Executable memory will be allocated for the instruction and the function's
//! prolog will be replaced.
//!
//! ```c
//! 0 int return_five() {
//! 1     return detour_function();
//! 00400020 [e9 16 00 00 00] jmp 1b <detour_function>
//! 00400025 [c3]             ret
//! 2 }
//! 3
//! 4 int detour_function() {
//! 5     return 10;
//! 00400040 [b8 0a 00 00 00] mov eax, 10
//! 00400045 [c3]             ret
//! 6 }
//! ```
//!
//! Beyond what is shown here, a trampoline is also generated so the original
//! function can be called regardless whether the function is hooked or not.
